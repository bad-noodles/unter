# Working Conditions
	Can you imagine living in a way that you fall sick today you won't have the money to eat tomorrow? What about if your car breaks you can't pay the rent or provide for your family?
	  Uber  - and similar platforms - drivers and deliverers usually have no form of social security, meaning that if anything prevents them from working it is the same as immediate unemployment. It also means that most of these people have no perspective of retirement.  
	  It is usually marketed that it is the type of job where you are your own boss and you can choose your own working hours. In practice you need to work at least the same work hours as other jobs, usually many more, and you need to work odd hours to be able to get a better fare and make some actual money. In practice you do have a boss, but it's invisible and you cannot do any sort of deal with them or complain about working conditions.  
	  For centuries people have fought for better working conditions and basic rights, such as having a pension at some point in their life instead of working until dying. But people that work in such platforms are having to start this fight almost from scratch.  
	  These issues are not only their issues, they impact you and the whole of society.  
	  How safe do you feel out in the streets when you have drivers around you working for 16 hours straight?  
	  How would you feel if one bad review of someone that was having a bad day could put you in danger of losing the way you provide for your family? What if one business decision from the company could mean sudden loss of hundreds, if not thousands, of jobs around you?  
	  Furthermore, this way of working is expanding and soon enough other jobs will work the same. It might feel great paying the super low fare for transportation, but it surely won't feel as great when you are the one being payed next to nothing for doing your job.  
# Where is your money going?
	It really depends on the stage in which the company you are hiring a service from is at right now.
	## Market expansion
		In the early stage - which we will call "market ~~kidnapping~~ expansion" - you are actually collaborating with some rich folks and both your and their money's are going to the same place.
		  Imagine Uber is new to your country, city or to that specific market. And it is an existing market, since taxis already existed and you could always call that pizza place and someone would deliver it to your door.  
		  These markets already had lots of, often, local companies that would provide that service for you. These companies would work with hired employees and the profit would go to someone that is local to your country or community, making for that healthy grease that makes the economy run smooth.  
		  The fresh new company comes in with much better deals! Paying 20 moneys for a ride? No way, Jos√©! It's only 7 on this new app where I just clickety click and don't need to call anyone.  
		  But wait, how do you get such amazing prices?  
		  Wealthy investors will put a lot of money into those big companies so they can operate with a loss margin. It means that the company is actually not making a profit on that ride, they are losing money.  
		  Do they do it out of the goodness of their hearts so you can pay less? Not really, they do it so smaller companies cannot compete and go bankrupt. Here is where the collaboration between you and some rich folks comes in, by hiring these services it's part your money and part their money that fuels that predatory practice.  
		  Oh, they also don't pay stuff like pension contribution, vacation or anything related to social security to their "employees". Huge cost saving there!  
	## King of the hill
		A company cannot operate at a loss forever! But luckily they don't need to, the just need to outlive a handful of smaller business and soon they will own close to 100% of the market. That stage is what we call ~~"Monopoly"~~ "King of the hill".
		  Here is where things get good! Boy, oh boy.  
		  Remember when you were paying almost no money for that ride? Forget that! Now we have monopoly pricing. If a single company is providing that service the good old competition has no effect on pricing and you will have to pay whatever price they decide on. Are paying the same as you did before them? Twice? Thrice? Just go use the competition. Wait... Never mind.  
		  It used to serve water and give me candies, where did that go?  
		  Did you forget something inside the car and the company give you really poor support?  
		  It's almost like the king of the hill doesn't care for you now that you don't have anyone else to provide that service for you. So weird!  
		  Best part is that most of your money is going to those wealthy investors that you were collaborating with earlier. They can finally afford that 17th sports car they wanted to buy without their fortune dropping from the billions. Phew!  
	In summary, you get nice technologies like ordering from an app a bit quicker than you would get organically, you end up paying double the price while the person that drove you around gets half the wage and none of the social security benefits.
	  It is not your fault though if you ever took an Uber to go somewhere. It's too good of an offer to decline and the side-effects are hidden away from you. But it would be better for everyone if we found a better alternative. A little bit of conscious spending  will go a long way in keeping your economy healthier and on making sure your job is not the next one to be done by an app contractor.  
## How do we turn things around?
	That is an uber question! Quite hard to answer effectively. What we are proposing is taking an unter approach and start from the base, reconstructing the local economy and companies with the technical advances that we grew accustomed to. Yes, you will still get an app!
	  Let's get back what was kidnapped!  
	  Imagine creating a company to compete with a big international company that is an expert in breaking small business.  
	  What about the technical investment to create an app that does all this real-time stuff?  
	  Will we have as many apps as we have companies providing this service?  
	  Different apps per city?  
	  What about travelling to another country and not seeing the local apps on my phone app store?  
	  Yeah, if we just go on the usual competitive each company for themselves approach we will not get very far.  
	  But if we work with a cooperative mindset we can get very far. Together we are strong, together we are legion!  
	What we need to empower small business to grow and cooperate together is:
		A single app where all customers can find what they are looking for;
		Lowered technical cost and challenge to setup such a company;
		Distributed ownership instead of a central monopoly.
	Unter tries to provide some of that with an open-source project that provides a single app already registered in all the relevant app stores and that allows for each company to self-host their part of the technical infrastructure with minimal technical knowledge.
	  Unter is still an idea and is not able to provide that, but we hope it will be in your phone some time soon helping to provide actual jobs for people.  
	  Unter loves entrepreneurship, but it loves when that entrepreneurship brings a better life for everyone involved. It strives to provide better conditions and a better life for you and your family.  
Each company sets their own coverage and services
	Which radius they cover
	Food delivery
	People transportation
	Other types of delivery
Each company will need to host they own service for the app to connect to
	No coding needed, simple deploying instructions
	No central company needs to handle all the costs
	Each company has a lowered entry cost
Companies need to follow some guidelines
	Provide proper employment and social security for their employees
	Not promote precarisation of work
	Provide a healthy relationship with the community it serves
The hosted services need to work as a mesh of auto-discoverable services
A central discovery service can be hosted by the project itself just to help new users and travelling users to discover the local services
The discovery process should be automatic and transparent to the end customer
Customers should be able to hire an specific company or person if they desire
Tips should go to the employee that served the customer
